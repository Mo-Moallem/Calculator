felt kind bored so decided to build something eazy and fast \
What is eazier than a Caculator!

So..
\
I will use HTML, CSS and js.

Lets start with some design I will look up some picture of cool Caculator as a refrence

First I want to find the font they used 
I tried to use some AI tools

did not work well

So I opened fonts.google.com

I fount this:

looks similar enough.

Lets find the collors 

#130F0E black

#FEE7D7 yollew-white

#593934 brown

#83665C light-brown

#FE652B orange

#D28471 pink?

#C28773 doubl-light-brown

let's start with some HTML

I changed the structure of html a bit to to help with the design.

For example we need some sub-text for the nubmers so I changed the structure of every button:

Now, with some sweet CSS I got it finally to look similar to the calc in the picture.

Not perfect but, a good start.
