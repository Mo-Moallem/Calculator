### Day 1
felt kind bored so decided to build something eazy and fast \
What is eazier than a Caculator!

So..
\
I will use HTML, CSS and js.

Lets start with some design I will look up some picture of cool Caculator as a refrence 


This Caculator look nice

First I want to find the font they used 
I tried to use some AI tools

did not work well

So I opened fonts.google.com

I fount this:

### Day 2
I changed the structure of html a bit to to help with the design.

For example we need some sub-text for the nubmers so I changed the structure of every button:

Now, with some sweet CSS I got it finally to look similar to the calc in the picture.

Not perfect but, a good start.

Okay, this is better

### Day 3



<img align="right" style="height: 11rem" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a4df54b-77ac-4bff-bf55-2e3a4f054e25">

Just placeholder for icon with an actuall one 


Problem: it seems the icons I'm looking for might hard to find online

Maybe I will have to design them.

Also changed bottme coners
